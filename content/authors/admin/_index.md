I am an ecologist with research interest in population ecology, human-animal interactions, behavioural ecology, wildlife conservation and management. I am also interested in investigating how social and environmental factors, and their interactions, influence the capacity for people and wildlife to coexist on shared landscapes. 
 The intersection of conservation and technology and its potential for biodiversity conservation is very appealing to me. I have used AI and machine learning tools to classify camera trap data. I have experience in carrying out otter surveys, Phase 1 & 2 Habitat survey, distance sampling, MARK, and Megadetector. In addition to that, I have experience in GIS, GPS, Camera trapping, R and Google earth engine. 
 I love being outdoor and reading when I am not delving into research!
